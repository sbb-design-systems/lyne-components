# Lyne Components

> _Lyne Components_ are the building blocks of the Lyne Design System
> and are based on standard compliant Web Components
> created using [Lit](https://lit.dev/) and
> browsable through [Storybook](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch/)

## 🎯 Our aim

To fulfill our [Vision](./docs/VISION.md), we are building and maintaining Lyne, our Design System, which is and acts
as our common language — our Single Source of Truth.
For this purpose we use [Design Tokens](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne-design-tokens) as our design abstractions.
Those [Design Tokens](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne-design-tokens) are consumed by Lyne Components and are integrated within our documentation.

Lyne Design Tokens and Lyne Components are available for developers and designers.
