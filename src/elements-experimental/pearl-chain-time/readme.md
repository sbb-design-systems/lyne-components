The `sbb-pearl-chain-time` component adds an optional walk icon and a duration in minutes
before and/or after the [sbb-pearl-chain](/docs/experimental-sbb-pearl-chain--docs).

The walk time indicates that the user has to walk to get to the destination, or to the station to begin the journey.

The `legs` property is mandatory.

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

```html
<sbb-pearl-chain-time
  legs="{legs}"
  departure-time="20:30"
  arrival-time="21:30"
  departure-walk="5"
  arrival-walk="3"
></sbb-pearl-chain-time>
```

To simulate the current datetime, you can use the `now` property,
which accepts a `Date` or a timestamp in milliseconds (as number or string).
This is helpful if you need a specific state of the component.
