The `sbb-image` component is used to render an image.

Mainly from cdn.img.sbb.ch (with `imageSrc`), but we can set an external image too.
The size can be set with `pictureSizesConfig`.

| `loading`            | `loading`              | public  | `InterfaceImageAttributes['loading']`         | `'eager'`        | With the support of native image lazy loading, we can now decide whether we want to load the image immediately or only once it is close to the visible viewport. The value eager is best used for images within the initial viewport. We want to load these images as fast as possible to improve the Core Web Vitals values. lazy on the other hand works best for images which are further down the page or invisible during the loading of the initial viewport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

In our case we will log the performance.mark into the PerformanceEntry API once the image is fully loaded. Performance monitoring tools like SpeedCurve or Lighthouse are then able to grab these entries from the PerformanceEntry API and give us additional information and insights about our page loading behaviour. We are then also able to monitor these values over a long period to see if our performance increases or decreases over time. Best to use lowercase strings here, separate words with underscores or dashes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `--sbb-image-aspect-ratio` | `auto`  | When the aspectRatio property on the component is set to 'free', the CSS declaration of the aspect ratio is set to var(--sbb-image-aspect-ratio, auto). Since CSS variables find their way into the shadow DOM, we can use the --sbb-image-aspect-ratio variable to override the aspect ratio at will. This way we can have, for example, an image component with an aspect ratio of 4/3 in smaller viewports and 16/9 in larger viewports. |
