The `sbb-clock` component displays an analog clock face in the style of the classic SBB station clock.

It mimics its behavior too, completing a rotation in approximately 58.5 seconds,
then it briefly pauses at the clock top before starting a new rotation.

<sbb-clock></sbb-clock>
```

## Testing

To specify a specific date for the current datetime, you can use the `data-now` attribute (timestamp in milliseconds).
This is helpful if you need a specific state of the component.
