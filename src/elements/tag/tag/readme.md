The `sbb-tag` is a component that can be used as a filter in order to categorize a large amount of information.
It's intended to be used inside the [sbb-tag-group](/docs/elements-sbb-tag-sbb-tag-group--docs) component.

```html
<sbb-tag value="All">All</sbb-tag>
```

## Slots

It is possible to provide a label via an unnamed slot; the component can optionally display a `sbb-icon`
at the component start using the `iconName` property or via custom content using the `icon` slot.

It's also possible to display a numeric amount at the component's end using the `amount` property or slot.

```html
<sbb-tag value="All" icon-name="pie-small" amount="123"> All </sbb-tag>

<sbb-tag value="None">
  <sbb-icon slot="icon" name="pie-small"></sbb-icon>
  None
  <span slot="amount">123</span>
</sbb-tag>
```

## States

The component can be displayed in `checked` or `disabled` state using the self-named property.

```html
<sbb-tag checked value="All" amount="123">All</sbb-tag>

<sbb-tag disabled value="All" icon-name="circle-information-small">All</sbb-tag>
```

## Style

The component has two sizes, named `m` (default) and `s`. The `size` property can also be set on the `sbb-tag-group` where it will be applied to all tags inside the group.

```html
<sbb-tag value="All" size="m">All</sbb-tag>

<sbb-tag value="All" size="s">All</sbb-tag>
```

## Events

Consumers can listen to the native `change` and `input` events on the `sbb-tag`.
The current state can be read from `event.target.checked`, while the value from `event.target.value`.
It's recommended to check the parent's `sbb-tag-group` for the value.

## Accessibility

The component imitates an `button` element to provide an accessible experience.
The state is reflected via `aria-pressed` attribute.

### Interactive disabled buttons

Native disabled elements cannot receive focus and do not dispatch any events. This can
be problematic in some cases because it can prevent the app from telling the user why the button is
disabled. Consumers can use the `disabledInteractive` property to style the button as disabled but allow for
it to receive focus and dispatch events. The button will have `aria-disabled="true"` for assistive
technology. It is the consumers responsibility to provide a reason for the element being disabled.
This can be achieved by adding an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.

**Note:** Using the `disabledInteractive` property can result in buttons that previously prevented
actions to no longer do so, for example a submit button in a form. When using this input, you should
guard against such cases in your component.

### Disabled elements

Generally speaking, `disabled` elements are considered a bad pattern for accessibility. They are invisible to assistive
technology and do not provide the reason for which they are disabled.
To partially address the problem, disabled elements are kept focusable (other interactions are still prevented).
However, it is still the consumers responsibility to provide a reason for the element being disabled.
This can be achieved by adding an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
