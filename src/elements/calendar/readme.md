The `sbb-calendar` component displays a calendar that allows the user to select a date.

While being deeply linked to the implementation of the [sbb-datepicker-toggle](/docs/elements-sbb-datepicker-sbb-datepicker-toggle--docs) component,
it can be used on its own.

```html
<sbb-calendar></sbb-calendar>
```

## Configuration

It's possible to set a date using the `dateSelected` property. Also, it's possible to place limits on the selection
using the two properties named `min` and `max`. For these three properties, the accepted formats are:

- Date objects
- ISO String
- Unix Timestamp (number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970)

It's recommended to set the time to 00:00:00.

```html
<sbb-calendar min="1599955200" max="1699920000" selected="1649980800"></sbb-calendar>
```

To simulate the current date, the `now` property can be used:
it accepts a `Date` or a timestamp in seconds (as number or string).
This is helpful whether a specific state of the component is needed.

```html
<sbb-calendar selected="1585699200" now="1587945600"></sbb-calendar>
```

By default, the component takes, in order of priority,
the `dateSelected` property, the `now` property or the current date to calculate which month it has to show.
It's possible to move to the previous/next month using the two buttons at the top of the component.

It's also possible to set a specific date by clicking on the month label between the buttons:
this action opens a list of twenty-four selectable years, and, after the year selection, the month list of that year.
Clicking on an element will set the month and restore the first view, allowing to select the desired day.

The `sbb-calendar` can be directly displayed in one of these modalities using the `view` property (default: `day`).

```html
<sbb-calendar selected="1585699200" view="month"></sbb-calendar>

<sbb-calendar selected="1585699200" view="year"></sbb-calendar>
```

It's also possible to filter out unwanted date using the `dateFilter` property.
Note that using the `dateFilter` function as a replacement for the `min` and `max` properties will most likely result in a significant loss of performance.

```ts
/** Returns only working days (Mon-Fri). */
const dateFilterFn: (d: Day) => boolean = d.getDay() !== 6 && d.getDay() !== 0;
```

```tsx
<sbb-calendar date-filter=${dateFilterFn}></sbb-calendar>
```

## Style

The component displays a single month / list of years / list of months by default;
setting the `wide` property to `true` it's possible to show, respectively, two consecutive months or
two sets of twenty-four years or the list of the twelve months for two consecutive years.

```html
<sbb-calendar wide="true" selected="1650000000"></sbb-calendar>
```

It's also possible to change the orientation of dates by setting the `orientation` property to `vertical`.
In this variant, the weekdays are displayed on the left side of the component and the days progress along the vertical direction.
This change is applied only to the day view.

```html
<sbb-calendar orientation="vertical"></sbb-calendar>
```

## Events

Consumers can listen to the `dateSelected` event on the `sbb-calendar` component to intercept the selected date
which can be read from `event.detail`.

## Keyboard interaction

It's possible to move within the component using the keyboard.

The days disabled due to the presence of the `min`, `max` and `dateFilter` properties are taken into account: for example,
pressing the `<kbd>Home</kbd>` when the first day of the month is disabled will result in moving to the first non-disabled day.
