The `sbb-alert-group` manages the accessibility of one or multiple
[sbb-alert](/docs/elements-sbb-alert-sbb-alert--docs) and also its visual gap between each other.

```html
<sbb-alert-group accessibility-title="Disruptions" accessibility-level="2">
  <sbb-alert size="l">
    <sbb-title level="3">Interruption between Genève and Lausanne</sbb-title>
    The rail traffic between Allaman and Morges is interrupted. All trains are cancelled.
    <sbb-link href="https://www.sbb.ch">Find out more</sbb-link>
  </sbb-alert>
  <sbb-alert>
    <sbb-title level="3">Interruption between Berne and Olten</sbb-title>
    Between Berne and Olten from 03.11.2021 to 05.12.2022 each time from 22:30 to 06:00 o'clock
    construction work will take place. You have to expect changed travel times and changed
    connections. <sbb-link href="https://www.sbb.ch">Find out more</sbb-link>
  </sbb-alert>
</sbb-alert-group>
```

## Interactions

If all the `sbb-alert`s are dismissed, it's recommended to completely remove the `sbb-alert-group` from DOM.

You can catch this moment by listening to `empty` event and react accordingly.

## Accessibility

By specifying the `accessibility-title` it's possible to add a hidden title to the `sbb-alert-group`.
The heading level can be set via `accessibility-title-level`.

By default, the `sbb-alert-group` has the role `status` which means that if a new alert arrives,
it will be read out as soon as the user is idle
(equal to [aria-live="polite"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions)).

You can change the `role` or `aria-live` attributes to fit your needs.
For example, you can set the `role` to `alert` which implicitly sets `aria-live` to `assertive`
and therefore interrupts screen reader flow, to immediately read out the alert content.

**Note that with role `alert`, in some combinations of screen readers and browsers not every part of the alert is fully read.**
