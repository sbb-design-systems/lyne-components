The `sbb-alert` is a component which should be used to display important messages to a client.

Multiple instances of this component can be used within
the [sbb-alert-group](/docs/elements-sbb-alert-sbb-alert-group--docs) component.

## Slots

The unnamed slot is used to project an `sbb-title`, text content and one or more `sbb-link` elements.

The component can optionally display an `sbb-icon` at the component start using the `iconName` property or via custom content using the `icon` slot.

```html
<sbb-alert icon-name="disruption">
  <sbb-title level="3">Interruption between Berne and Olten</sbb-title>
  Between Bern and Olten from 03.11.2021 to 05.12.2022 each time from 22:30 to 06:00 o'clock
  construction work will take place. You have to expect changed travel times and changed
  connections. <sbb-link href="https://www.sbb.ch">Find out more</sbb-link>
</sbb-alert>

<sbb-alert>
  <sbb-title level="3">Interruption between Berne and Olten</sbb-title>
  <sbb-icon slot="icon" name="disruption"></sbb-icon>
  Between Bern and Olten from 03.11.2021 to 05.12.2022 each time from 22:30 to 06:00 o'clock
  construction work will take place. You have to expect changed travel times and changed
  connections. <sbb-link href="https://www.sbb.ch">Find out more</sbb-link>
</sbb-alert>
```

The `sbb-alert` can optionally be hidden by a user, if the `readOnly` prop is not set.

```html
<sbb-alert readonly>
  <sbb-title level="3">Interruption between Berne and Olten</sbb-title>
  Between Bern and Olten from 03.11.2021 to 05.12.2022 each time from 22:30 to 06:00 o'clock
  construction work will take place. You have to expect changed travel times and changed
  connections.
</sbb-alert>
```

## Style

Users can choose between three `size`: `s`, `m` (default) and `l`.

```html
<sbb-alert size="s"> ... </sbb-alert>

<sbb-alert size="l"> ... </sbb-alert>
```

## Accessibility

Accessibility is mainly done by wrapping the alerts into the `sbb-alert-group`.

The description text is wrapped into an `<p>` element to guarantee the semantic meaning.

Avoid slotting block elements (e.g. `<div>`) as this violates semantic rules and can have negative effects on screen readers.

## Animation

Set the `animation` property to manage which animations are enabled.
As a base rule, opening animations should be active if an alert arrives after the initial page load.
