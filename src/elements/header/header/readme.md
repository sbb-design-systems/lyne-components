The `sbb-header` component is a container for actions and a logo, and it is displayed at the top of the page.

## Slots

It has two slots:
the first one can contain one or more action ([sbb-header-button](/docs/elements-sbb-header-sbb-header-button--docs) or
[sbb-header-link](/docs/elements-sbb-header-sbb-header-link--docs))
or other action items like [sbb-button](/docs/elements-sbb-button--docs) or [sbb-link](/docs/elements-sbb-link--docs),
and it is displayed at the left end of the component; the second slot is displayed at the right end,
and it can contain a logo or a signet, which by default is the [sbb-logo](/docs/elements-sbb-logo--docs).

```html
<sbb-header>
  <sbb-header-link icon-name="hamburger-menu-small" href="https://sbb.ch/somewhere"
    >Menu</sbb-header-link
  >
  <sbb-header-button icon-name="magnifying-glass-small">Search</sbb-header-button>
  <a slot="logo" href="/">
    <sbb-logo protective-room="none"></sbb-logo>
  </a>
</sbb-header>
```

## Style

Setting the `expanded` property will cause the `sbb-header` component to take up the full width of the page.

To avoid that tabbed/focused elements get hidden behind the header,
it's recommended to set on the `<html>` tag the CSS property `scroll-padding-top` to `var(--sbb-header-height)` or to a greater value.
With this, it's ensured that content will be visible all the time.

The component has two sizes, named `m` (default) and `s`.
For the latter, the usage of the `sbb-signet` with `protective-room='panel'` is suggested.

```html
<sbb-header size="s">
  <sbb-header-link icon-name="hamburger-menu-small" href="https://sbb.ch/somewhere"
    >Menu</sbb-header-link
  >
  <sbb-header-button icon-name="magnifying-glass-small">Search</sbb-header-button>
  <sbb-signet slot="logo" protective-room="panel"></sbb-signet>
</sbb-header>
```

### Positioning and visibility

By default, the `sbb-header` has a fixed position at the top of the page;
when the page is scrolled down, a box-shadow appears below it and the component remains visible.
It's possible to change this behavior by setting the `hideOnScroll` property to `true`, or adding the `hide-on-scroll`
attribute: in this case, the box-shadow is still set, but the component disappears when the page is scrolled down and
then reappears as soon as it's scrolled up. It's also possible to bind this behaviour to something other than the `document`,
using the `scrollOrigin` property, which accepts an `HTMLElement` or the id of the element to search for.

```html
<sbb-header expanded hideOnScroll>
  <sbb-header-button icon-name="magnifying-glass-small">Search</sbb-header-button>
  <a href="https://www.sbb.ch" slot="logo">
    <sbb-logo protective-room="none"></sbb-logo>
  </a>
</sbb-header>
```

### Customizing

Users can customize position and behaviour of actions inside the `sbb-header` component
by adding classes to `sbb-header-button`/`sbb-header-link` elements and then defining their own style rules.

[All the examples in Storybook](/story/elements-sbb-header-sbb-header--basic) have the following requirements:

- four action items (with custom icons);
- the first item is always left aligned and has `expand-from` set to `small`;
- the other three items are left aligned in breakpoints zero to medium, and right aligned from large to ultra;
- the last item is not visible in breakpoints zero to small.

To achieve this result, a `div` tag with a CSS class named `sbb-header-spacer` was added between the first
and the second `sbb-header-button` item, then a class named `last-element` was added to the last one.
Finally, the following custom CSS has been added(\*). The result can be seen in the home and home--logged-in stories.

```css
.last-element {
  display: none;
}

@media screen and (width >= 840px) {
  .last-element {
    display: block;
  }
}

@media screen and (width < 1024px) {
  .sbb-header-spacer {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

### Content overflow

If a certain `sbb-header-button`/`sbb-header-link` should be shrunken (receive ellipsis) when there is too little space,
set the CSS class `sbb-header-shrinkable` on the desired `sbb-header-button`/`sbb-header-link`.

```html
<sbb-header shadow="true">
  <sbb-header-link icon-name="hamburger-menu-small" href="https://sbb.ch/somewhere" target="_blank">
    Menu
  </sbb-header-link>
  <sbb-header-button class="sbb-header-shrinkable">
    Christina Müller has a long name
  </sbb-header-button>
</sbb-header>
```

(\*) Technical note: Due the presence of media-query rules, it was not possible to add those rules directly
in the component's stories (see also [this Storybook issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/8820)),
so they were wrapped into a `style` tag and added to the Storybook's configuration file named `preview-head.html`.
