The `sbb-mini-calendar` is a component used to display a minimal calendar.

It must be used in combination with one or more [sbb-mini-calendar-month](/docs/elements-sbb-mini-calendar-sbb-mini-calendar-month),
each one slotting the requested [sbb-mini-calendar-day](/docs/elements-sbb-mini-calendar-sbb-mini-calendar-day)

```html
<sbb-mini-calendar>
  <sbb-mini-calendar-month date="2025-01">
    <sbb-mini-calendar-day date="2025-01-01"></sbb-mini-calendar-day>
    ...
  </sbb-mini-calendar-month>
  <sbb-mini-calendar-month date="2025-02">
    <sbb-mini-calendar-day date="2025-02-01"></sbb-mini-calendar-day>
    ...
  </sbb-mini-calendar-month>
  ...
</sbb-mini-calendar>
```

## Slots

The `sbb-mini-calendar-month` are provided via an unnamed slot.
Consumers should check the accuracy of the slotted data, since there's no check on missing or wrongly formatted data.

## Style

The orientation of the days in each month can be set using the `orientation` property, which default value is `horizontal`.

```html
<sbb-mini-calendar orientation="vertical"> ... </sbb-mini-calendar>
```

## Keyboard interaction

It's possible to move within the component using the keyboard.
