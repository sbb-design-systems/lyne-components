The `sbb-secondary-button` component provides the same functionality as a native `<button>`
enhanced with the SBB Design in the 'secondary' variant.

```html
<sbb-secondary-button>Button text</sbb-secondary-button>
```

## Slots

The button text is provided via an unnamed slot; the component can optionally display a `sbb-icon`
at the component start using the `iconName` property or via custom content using the `icon` slot.
At least one is mandatory, so you can have a `sbb-secondary-button` with icon only, text only, or with both.

```html
<sbb-secondary-button icon-name="info"> Button text </sbb-secondary-button>

<sbb-secondary-button>
  <sbb-icon slot="icon" name="info"></sbb-icon>
  Button text
</sbb-secondary-button>

<sbb-secondary-button
  icon-name="info"
  aria-label="Click for more information."
></sbb-secondary-button>
```

## Button properties

The component is internally rendered as a button,
accepting its associated properties (`type`, `name`, `value` and `form`).

```html
<sbb-secondary-button type="submit" name="tickets" form="buy" value="tickets">
  Buy tickets
</sbb-secondary-button>
```

## Style

The component has a negative variant which can be set using the `negative` property.

There are two different sizes (`m` and `l`, which is the default) that can be set using the `size` property.

The component can be displayed in `disabled` state using the self-named property.

```html
<sbb-secondary-button negative>Button</sbb-secondary-button>

<sbb-secondary-button size="m">Button</sbb-secondary-button>

<sbb-secondary-button disabled>Button</sbb-secondary-button>
```

### Focus outline

Please make sure that the focus outline appears in the correct color if the component is used on a dark background.
You can set it by re-defining the css var on `sbb-secondary-button` or any parent element:

```css
sbb-secondary-button {
  --sbb-focus-outline-color: var(--sbb-focus-outline-color-dark);
}
```

## Accessibility

Use the accessibility properties in case of an icon-only button to describe the purpose of the `sbb-secondary-button` for screen-reader users.

### Disabled buttons

Generally speaking, `disabled` elements are considered a bad pattern for a11y. They are invisible to assistive technology and do not provide the reason for which they are disabled.
To partially address the problem, disabled elements are kept focusable (other interactions are still prevented).
Still, the consumer's responsible for providing the reason for a disabled element.
