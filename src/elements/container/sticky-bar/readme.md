The `sbb-sticky-bar` is a component meant to be slotted inside a `sbb-container` component.
It is displayed with sticky positioning at the bottom of the container that contains it.

```html
<sbb-container>
  <sbb-sticky-bar>
    <!-- Sticky bar content. -->
  </sbb-sticky-bar>
</sbb-container>
```

## Animate from sticky to normal content flow and vice versa

By default, the sticky bar is set to `position: sticky`. In certain cases, the consumer needs
to control the sliding out (or sliding in) of the sticky bar.
By calling the `stick()` or `unstick()` methods, the position property is toggled
between `position: sticky` and `position: relative` by displaying a slide animation. When the sticky bar is `unstick`,
the `sbb-sticky-bar` will behave like a normal container without any sticky behavior.
Whenever the sticky bar is currently not sticky (e.g. scrolled down),
calling `stick()` or `unstick()` won't have any visual effect.

An example use case is to call `unstick()`, which visually slides out the sticky bar, and
then the consumer can remove it from the DOM by listening to the `unstick` event.

## Slots

The `sbb-sticky-bar` content is provided via an unnamed slot.

## Style

The `sbb-sticky-bar` inherits its variant from the `sbb-container` it's placed in.
Optionally the user can set the `color` property on the `sbb-sticky-bar` in order to override the one inherited by the `sbb-container`.
The color is only applied when the sticky bar is sticking, and will become transparent once it settles on the bottom of the container.

The component has two sizes, `m` and `s`, that can be set using the `size` property.
