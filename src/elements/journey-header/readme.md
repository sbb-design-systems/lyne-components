The `sbb-journey-header` is a component used to display the journey's details.

The component has two required properties, named `origin` and `destination`,
which represents the two ends of the journey.
An icon is placed between them: if the property `roundTrip` is set to false (default),
the icon is an arrow pointing to the `destination`, otherwise it is a double arrow to display the round-trip.

```html
<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B"></sbb-journey-header>

<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B" round-trip></sbb-journey-header>
```

## Style

The component has a `level` property, which is passed to its inner `sbb-title` component;
it is rendered as a heading from `h1` to `h6`. Default `level` is `3`.

The component also has three sizes, named `s`, `m` (default) and `l`, and a `negative` background variant.

```html
<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B" size="s"></sbb-journey-header>

<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B" size="l"></sbb-journey-header>

<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B" level="5"></sbb-journey-header>

<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B" negative></sbb-journey-header>
```

## Accessibility

The component has some hidden elements in order to be correctly read from a screen-reader.

The following example will be read as (locale: ENG): `Connection from Point A to Point B.`.

```html
<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B"></sbb-journey-header>
```

The following one will be read as (locale: ENG): `Connection from Point A to Point B and back to Point A.`.

```html
<sbb-journey-header origin="Point A" destination="Point B" round-trip="true"></sbb-journey-header>
```
