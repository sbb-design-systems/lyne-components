The `sbb-block-link-button` component provides the same functionality as a native `<button>`,
despite its appearance as a link enhanced with the SBB Design.

## Slots

The text is provided via an unnamed slot; the component can optionally display a `sbb-icon` using
the `iconName` property or via custom content using the `icon` slot.
By default, the icon is placed at the component's end, but this can be changed using the `iconPlacement` property.

```html
<sbb-block-link-button value="help"> Help </sbb-block-link-button>

<sbb-block-link-button value="contact" icon-name="chevron-small-left-small" icon-placement="start">
  Contact
</sbb-block-link-button>
```

## States

The component can be displayed in `disabled` state using the self-named property.

```html
<sbb-block-link-button disabled>Refunds</sbb-block-link-button>
```

## Button properties

The component is internally rendered as a button,
accepting its associated properties (`type`, `name`, `value` and `form`).

```html
<sbb-block-link-button name="tickets" form="buy" value="tickets">
  Travel-cards and tickets
</sbb-block-link-button>
```

## Style

The component has three sizes (`xs`, `s`, which is the default, and `m`).

```html
<sbb-block-link-button size="m">Refunds</sbb-block-link-button>
```

## Accessibility

### Disabled buttons

Generally speaking, `disabled` elements are considered a bad pattern for a11y. They are invisible to assistive
technology and do not provide the reason for which they are disabled.
To partially address the problem, disabled elements are kept focusable (other interactions are still prevented).
However, it is still the consumers responsibility to provide a reason for the element being disabled.
This can be achieved by adding an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
