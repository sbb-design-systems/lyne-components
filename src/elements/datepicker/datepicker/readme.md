The `sbb-datepicker` is a component which can be used together with a native `<input>` element
to display the typed value as a formatted date (default: `dd.MM.yyyy`).

The component allows the insertion of up to 10 numbers, possibly with separators like `.`, `-`, ` `, `,` or `/`,
then automatically formats the value as date and displays it.
It also allows to get / set the value formatted as Date via the `valueAsDate` property.

The component and the native `<input>` can be connected using the `input` property,
which accepts the id of the native input, or directly its reference.

```html
<input id="datepicker-input" />
<sbb-datepicker input="datepicker-input" id="datepicker"></sbb-datepicker>
```

## In `sbb-form-field`

If the `sbb-datepicker` is used within a [sbb-form-field](/docs/elements-sbb-form-field-sbb-form-field--docs) with a native input,
they are automatically linked; the component sets the input placeholder and the input's type as `text`,
then reads the `disabled`, `readonly`, `min` and `max` attributes from the input and emits then as payload of the `inputUpdated` event.

It's possible to remove unwanted dates from selection using the `dateFilter` function, however, this should **not**
be used as a replacement for the `min` and `max` properties will most likely result in a significant loss of performance.

It's also possible to display a two-months view using the `wide` property.

```html
<sbb-form-field>
  <input />
  <sbb-datepicker></sbb-datepicker>
</sbb-form-field>
```

```html
<!-- Component's usage with all the related components. -->
<sbb-form-field>
  <sbb-datepicker-previous-day></sbb-datepicker-previous-day>
  <sbb-datepicker-toggle></sbb-datepicker-toggle>
  <input value="01.01.2023" min="1600000000" max="1700000000" />
  <sbb-datepicker></sbb-datepicker>
  <sbb-datepicker-next-day></sbb-datepicker-next-day>
</sbb-form-field>
```

## Events

If the input's value changes, it is formatted then a `change` event is emitted with the new value.
If it's an invalid date, the `data-sbb-invalid` attribute is added to the input.
The component also listens for changes in its two properties, `wide` and `dateFilter`, and emits a
`datePickerUpdated` event when changed.

Consumers can listen to the native `change` and `input` events on the `sbb-datepicker` component to
intercept date changes. The `valueAsDate` property on the `sbb-datepicker` can be used to read the
current value (e.g. from `event.target.valueAsDate`) or to set the value programmatically.

When the `valueAsDate` property is programmatically assigned, a `blur` event is fired on the input
to ensure compatibility with any framework that relies on that event to update the current state.

## Custom current date

To simulate the current date, you can use the `now` property,
which accepts a `Date` or a timestamp in seconds (as number or string).
This is helpful if you need a specific state of the component.

## Validation Change

Whenever the validation state changes (e.g., a valid value becomes invalid or vice-versa), the `validationChange` event is emitted.
