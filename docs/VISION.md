## What *Lyne* is and why we need it
The *[Lyne Design System](./TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne)* is a holistic approach towards a consistent, maintainable, cross-company design language for all SBB digital products/services for a better common understanding between stakeholders, designers and developers.

## What *Lyne* consists of
The *[Lyne Design System](./TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne)* is based on a intuitive, unique — the [Single Source of Truth](./TERMINOLOGY.md#single-source-of-truth) — referential resource, including shared and well-documented guidelines, [terminologies](./TERMINOLOGY.md), processes and vocabulary ([Design Tokens](./TERMINOLOGY.md#design-token)), as well as centralized, vendor and framework agnostic basic building blocks ([Lyne Components](./TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne-components)).

## What *Lyne* does
The *[Lyne Design System](./TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne)* not only enables an optimized collaboration and integration workflow between the [Design System Core Team](./TERMINOLOGY.md#design-system-core-team) and consumers of *[Lyne Design System](./TERMINOLOGY.md#lyne)* but also accelerates the creation and development process (time to market) in a sustainable, maintainable, and long term committed fashion.

## Risks
General risks of a Design System which we always need to face and be aware of.

- Single point of failure
- Restrains designers creativity
- Governance difficulties
    - Design System rejection/denial
    - Missing adoption
- Documentation — if not well enough documented
- Funding difficulties
