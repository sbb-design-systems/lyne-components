# Getting Started

Basic steps to integrate the lyne components into your project.

Select your technology to get started.

<details>
  <summary>Plain Javascript</summary>

1. Install the `@sbb-esta/lyne-elements` and `@sbb-esta/lyne-elements-experimental` package:

   ```sh
   npm install --save @sbb-esta/lyne-elements @sbb-esta/lyne-elements-experimental
   ```

   or, if using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn add @sbb-esta/lyne-elements @sbb-esta/lyne-elements-experimental
   ```

2. Including global styles is strongly recommended to apply all SBB styles to your application.
   See [styles](#styles) section if you prefer more granularity on what to import.

   ```css
   @import 'node_modules/@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/standard-theme.css';
   ```

3. Import the desired element and add it to globalThis:

   ```ts
   import { SbbButtonElement } from '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/button.js';

   globalThis.SbbButtonElement = SbbButtonElement;
   ```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Angular</summary>

> ⓘ We provide a Lyne Angular wrapper which helps to use lyne components in Angular. It's currently in beta state, see
> https://github.com/sbb-design-systems/lyne-angular for more information.
> However, it's possible to use Lyne Components in Angular without the wrapper:.

1. Install Angular CLI, see [Angular CLI documentation](https://cli.angular.io/)
2. Install the `@sbb-esta/lyne-elements` package:

   ```sh
   npm install --save @sbb-esta/lyne-elements
   ```

   or, if using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn add @sbb-esta/lyne-elements
   ```

3. Including global styles is strongly recommended to apply all SBB styles to your application.
   See [styles](#styles) section if you prefer more granularity on what to import.
   Importing stylsheets is doable by editing the `styles.(s)css`:

   ```css
   @import 'node_modules/@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/standard-theme.css';
   ```

   or editing your `angular.json`:

   ```json
     ...
     "styles": [
       "src/styles.scss",
       "node_modules/@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/standard-theme.css"
     ],
     ...
   ```

4. In order to use web components with Angular, you have to import `CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA` from the `@angular/core` package.

5. In each component, import the lyne components, which you want to use, in the typescript file: e.g. `import '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/button.js';`

### Example app

```ts
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, Component } from '@angular/core';
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';

import '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/button.js';

@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  standalone: true,
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  template: ` <sbb-button>Lorem ipsum</sbb-button> `,
})
export class App {}

bootstrapApplication(App).catch((err) => console.error(err));
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>React/Next.js</summary>

1. Prepare a React and Next.js setup.
2. Install the `@sbb-esta/lyne-react` package:

   ```sh
   npm install --save @sbb-esta/lyne-react
   ```

   or, if using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn add @sbb-esta/lyne-react
   ```

3. Including global styles is strongly recommended to apply all SBB styles to your application.
   See [styles](#styles) section if you prefer more granularity on what to import.

   ```css
   @import '~@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/standard-theme.css';
   ```

4. Enhance the `transpilePackages` array in Next.Js config.

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     ...,
     transpilePackages: [
       '@sbb-esta/lyne-react',
       '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements',
       '@lit/react',
       '@lit/reactive-element',
       'lit',
       'lit-html',
       'lit-element',
     ],
   }
   ```

5. (Optional) To activate Server Side Rendering with Declarative Shadow DOM, you have to install the `@lit-labs/nextjs` package and use the method `withLitSSR()`:

   ```js
   const withLitSSR = require('@lit-labs/nextjs')({
     addDeclarativeShadowDomPolyfill: true,
   });

   module.exports = withLitSSR({
       ...,
       transpilePackages: [
         '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements',
         '@sbb-esta/lyne-react',
         '@sbb-esta/lyne-design-tokens',
         '@lit-labs/nextjs',
         '@lit-labs/ssr',
         '@lit-labs/ssr-react',
         '@lit/react',
         '@lit/reactive-element',
         'lit',
         'lit-element',
         'lit-html',
       ],
     });
   ```

6. Import and use lyne component:

   ```tsx
   import { SbbButton } from '@sbb-esta/lyne-react/button';

   export default function MyComponent() {
     return <SbbButton onClick={() => {}}></SbbButton>;
   }
   ```

   Whenever e.g. types are needed, they can be imported directly from the `@sbb-esta/lyne-elements` package:

   ```tsx
   import type { SbbButtonSize } from '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/button.js';
   import { SbbButton } from '@sbb-esta/lyne-react/button';

   export default function MyComponent() {
     const size: SbbButtonSize = 'm';
     return <SbbButton onClick={() => {}} size={size}></SbbButton>;
   }
   ```

</details>

## Components

Components documentation is available on [digital.sbb.ch](https://digital.sbb.ch)
and on [storybook](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch).

## Styles

### Lean variant

Lean uses a more compact design by defaulting the `size` property to the smallest available value.
Components that do not have a `size` property remain unchanged.
To enable lean mode, add the CSS class `sbb-lean` to the `html` tag.

```html
<html lang="en" class="sbb-lean">
  <head>
    <title>Lyne Design System - Lean example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

### CSS files

Basically, all our styles are included in 'standard-theme.css' which should be included in your application.
However, if you like to more specifically pick what you need, consider the following CSS files available.

| File name                       | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `standard-theme.css`            | Contains normalizing, core styles and available CSS classes.                        |
| `font-characters-extension.css` | Provides full character set of SBB fonts, needs larger files to fetch.              |

| `normalize.css`                 | Contains general browser resetting styles which can be useful for your application. |
|                                 |                                                                                     |
| `core.css`                      | Contains mandatory basics to use lyne-components (including design tokens).         |
|                                 |                                                                                     |
| `a11y.css`                      | Provides accessibility related CSS classes.                                         |
| `badge.css`                     | Provides badge styling.                                                             |
| `animation.css`                 | Provides CSS classes to disable animation (e.g. for testing).                       |
| `layout.css`                    | Provides layout related CSS classes (e.g. page spacing, grid).                      |
| `lists.css`                     | Provides CSS classes to style lists.                                                |
| `scrollbar.css`                 | Provides CSS classes to style a scrollbar.                                          |
| `table.css`                     | Provides CSS classes to style a table.                                              |
| `typography.css`                | Provides typography related CSS classes.                                            |

### Full Font

The `standard-theme.css` (or `core.css`) file only contains a subset of the `SBB` fonts that do not contain all characters (e.g. the French "œ").
For including the full fontset, we provide the `font-characters-extension.css` file which can be added after the `standard-theme.css` (or `core.css`) file.

```css
@import '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/standard-theme.css';
@import '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/font-characters-extension.css';
```

### Design Tokens

The `@sbb-esta/lyne-elements` package provides the CSS variable design tokens
from `@sbb-esta/lyne-design-tokens` in the `standard-theme.css` (or `core.css`).

> If you have to use design tokens within a javascript context,
> please also add `@sbb-esta/lyne-design-tokens` package to your project.

Please check `node_modules/@sbb-esta/lyne-elements/standard-theme.css` for available design tokens.

#### How to work with design tokens

Designers are using design tokens in Figma from which developers can get the name to be used.
Some design tokens are responsive: they change their value depending on the current breakpoint.

> Whenever a design token ends with `-{breakpoint}`, e.g. `--sbb-spacing-responsive-s-zero`,
> There is a corresponding responsive CSS variable without the `-breakpoint` suffix,
> e.g. `sbb-spacing-responsive-s` which should be used.

### Sass Mixins

Lyne Components provides various Sass mixins which can be used by consumers.
For available Sass mixins, check [Sass Mixins](https://github.com/sbb-design-systems/lyne-components/tree/main/src/elements/core/styles/mixins).

```scss
@use '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements' as sbb;

.my-class {
  @include sbb.grid-base;
}
```

### CSS Classes

As a base rule, styles are included in components. However, there are a few exceptions
where we provide CSS classes to consumers:

- [Layout styles](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch/?path=/docs/styles-layout--docs)
- [List styles](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch/?path=/docs/styles-list--docs)
- [Scrollbar styles](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch/?path=/docs/styles-scrollbar--docs)
- [Text styles](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch/?path=/docs/styles-typography--docs)

### Manipulating styles of components

In general, the styles of components should not be changed.
However, some specific cases may require overriding some styles of a component.
For these cases, you can use the CSS variables of a component. Please check a specific component for available CSS variables.

> IMPORTANT: CSS variable names which are not documented in the component docs section, can be changed at any time.

Please reach out to the Lyne team if you think a component needs a new variant.

### Animations

Generally, animations are part of the design and should not be suppressed.
However, e.g. for testing purposes, it makes sense to deactivate them.

Add the `sbb-disable-animation` CSS class to disable animations and transition effects for the element and all its children.

Sometimes, you might need to disable animations only for a specific element.
To achieve that, you can add the `sbb-disable-animation-locally` class or re-enable animations using the `sbb-enable-animation` CSS class.

```html
<sbb-component class="sbb-disable-animation-locally">
  <!-- animations will play -->
</sbb-component>

<!-- Or  alternatively-->

<sbb-component class="sbb-disable-animation">
  <sbb-component class="sbb-enable-animation">
    <!-- animations will play -->
  </sbb-component>
</sbb-component>
```

### Units

All our tokens and components use `rem` as size unit.
We strongly recommend using the `rem` unit to guarantee consistent scaling
when font size changes in browsers.

### Focus outline

Focus outlines should only be displayed when users are navigating by keyboard.
Lyne components use the CSS selector `:focus-visible`, to achieve that. Whenever you have custom interactive elements,
you should use the `:focus-visible` selector as well and include our Sass mixin `focus-outline`.

```scss
@use '../../core/styles' as sbb;

button:focus-visible {
  @include sbb.focus-outline;
}
```

#### Dark background

If a container element has a dark background color, all containing interactive elements should get a white outline.
By setting `--sbb-focus-outline-color: var(--sbb-focus-outline-color-dark);` all descendants elements using the
Lyne focus outline mixin (Lyne components included) receive the white outline because the variable gets inherited.
Note: If a Lyne component has a `negative` property, the correct focus outline color gets automatically applied  
to all contained interactive elements.

### Stacking

Our overlay components internally use the Popover API to take advantage of positioning elements on the top layer.
As of January 2025, the browser support for the Popover API is at
[90%](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover#browser_compatibility)
and available for all [our supported browsers](https://github.com/sbb-design-systems/lyne-components?tab=readme-ov-file#-browser-and-screen-reader-support).
If you need to support older browsers, you can either attempt to use a polyfill or
manually configure the stacking order of the overlays.
Doing it manually may interfere with the z-index of your components.
Therefore, each overlay component provides a CSS variable to override its z-index.
Additionally, there is a global CSS variable `--sbb-overlay-default-z-index` which has a default z-index of 1000.
This allows developers to change the z-index either globally or at component level.
In some cases, it's not possible to break out of a particular stacking context. In this case, keep the trigger within
your component, but moving the overlay component out of the stacking context can help.

### Fonts

SBB provides different fonts depending on the font-weight: `Roman`, `Bold` and `Light`.
Lyne maps these fonts on the CSS `font-weight` property so that consumers
can just set e.g. `font-weight: bold` and the correct font gets automatically selected.
Please note, although SBB provides more fonts than `Roman`, `Bold` and `Light`,
Lyne only intends to use these three fonts.
To apply the SBB font family you can use the CSS var `var(--sbb-typo-font-family)`. However,
this only includes the family but no letter spacing, so we recommend to always
use our Sass mixins or CSS classes which contain all necessary properties.
See [Text styles](https://lyne-storybook.app.sbb.ch/?path=/docs/styles-typography--docs) for what's available.

```html
<p class="sbb-text-s sbb-text--bold"></p>
```

```scss
@use '@sbb-esta/lyne-elements' as sbb;

p {
  @include sbb.text-s--bold;
}
```

## Form Support

Our form elements implement native form support:
https://web.dev/articles/more-capable-form-controls
This means our form elements can be used with `<form>` elements, emit `input`
events and integrate native form validation.

### Validation API

All of our form elements provide properties and methods for validation and
some implement specific validation functionality
(e.g. `<sbb-checkbox required>`, `<sbb-radio-button required>`).

#### `readonly form: HTMLFormElement | null`

The `form` readonly property returns the current reference to the associated
`<form>` instance, if available.

#### `readonly validity: ValidityState`

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ValidityState

The `validity` property return the current validity state of an element.

#### `readonly validationMessage: string`

The `validationMessage` property returns the currently applicable validation
message. Please note that only one message is returned at a time (e.g. if
multiple validity states are invalid, only the chronologically first one is
returned until it is fixed, at which point the next message might be returned,
if it is still applicable). Also a custom validity message (see below) has
precedence over native validation messages.

#### `readonly willValidate: boolean`

The `willValidate` returns true if the element will be validated
when the form is submitted; false otherwise

#### `checkValidity(): boolean`

The `checkValidity()` method returns true if the element has no validity
problems; false otherwise. Fires an invalid event at the element in the
latter case.

#### `setCustomValidity(message: string): void`

By using `setCustomValidity(message: string)` it's possible to define a custom validation
message which is set on the element. Use the empty string to indicate that the element
does not have a custom validity error.
With this method, the validation state of the element can be controlled from outside.
