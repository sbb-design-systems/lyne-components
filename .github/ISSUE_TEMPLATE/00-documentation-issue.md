Hi there! 👋🏾 It looks like you were having an issue with our documentation.

If you miss something or you have not yet found an answer to your question the [Lyne Components documentation](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne-components/docs) might hold it.

Maybe also have a quick look at our [documentation issues](https://github.com/lyne-design-system/lyne-components/issues?q=label%3A%22type%3A+docs+%F0%9F%93%96%22+) if your question has been asked/raised before or even might have been solved.

If those resources do not help or if something needs to be optimized/incomplete, is wrong or outdated in our documentation, help us out by filling out some details below!

Feel free to remove the sections that are not relevant.

Thanks in advance!
