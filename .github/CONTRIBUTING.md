# Contributing

## Our contribution model

Lyne Design System is an **open source** project at SBB-CFF-FFS. We foster
open and inclusive design and development. If you are wondering about our
contribution process, you are in the right place. First off, thank you for 
your interest!

**But since we are in very early development phase, contributions are limited to 
the [Design System Core Team](/docs/TERMINOLOGY.md#design-system-core-team). Once this project will be more mature, we invite
the community to participate and contribute to the Lyne Design System.**

## Code of conduct

We value all of our community members, and thus want to foster a positive
contribution environment. Please take a look at our
[code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before engaging in our workspaces.
